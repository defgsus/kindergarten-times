### Historic timeline of arrival at kindergarten

It's about 20 to 25 minutes by bike to the lovely kindergarten. 
The latest time i'm supposed to be there is at about 9:00, 
which i rarely manage. 

[Here](times.csv) is the historic timeline of the arrival times, starting
at 2021-06-29, where i'm recording the arrival at the front door.

I do not know about the *kindergarten arrival politics* in other
countries but in Germany, coming late is usually sanctioned 
with unfriendly blaming, to say the least. Our kindergarten is quite
different. I never got blustered at but occasionally i'm informed
that it would be good for the kid to arrive not later than 9 o'clock
so she can join the different activities which start then. 

The tag `overslept` in the table means that either my kid or myself
slept too long and we would arrive far too late, potentially just
before the midday sleep.

The tag `skived` means various things, voluntary or involuntary. I 
do not want to record an illness history so it basically just means
that we did not go to kindergarten without having overslept.

There's another 3 years of kindergarten ahead before we actually 
have to check-in at school before 8 o'clock. It seems not a big deal
for most people but i'm already scared!
